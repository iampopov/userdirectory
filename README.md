# Employee Directory

## Overview

This app is an employee directory using React. This application's UI broken up into components, manages component state using hooks, and responds to user events.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Functionality

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders.

The user is able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.
